[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) Bot that can:


-send the messages from users on his own behalf in both text and voice channels (anonymization of communication)
-output various information from Blizzard API
-output various information from [WoWhead] (wowhead.com) (web scrapping)
-output useful links related to WoW
-work with the list of raiders (create, edit and clear by user commands)
-submit information about users and server which it works on
-and other little things

Initially, it was planned that the bot would be able to recognize the voice commands of users, interpritate them and execute, if necessary, using voice himself by Google tts or Yandex technologies (at that time i get acquainted with YandexCloud and SpeechKit). However, as it became clear during the development process, that will be quite difficult to achieve due to the various limitations of the capabilities of the bots imposed by Discord itself. Since while I was working on a bot, I was part of a small community dedicated to the game World of Warcraft, which was cooperating in the Discord, the bot has different functions related to the game one way or another.
